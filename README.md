This repository provides all relevant codes and data to replicate the analysis of of the reproduction number and vaccination coverage estimates of MMR in the 2025 measles outbreak in northwest Texas. We additionally provide a supplemental appendix of extended methods, results, and sensitivity analyses to complement our publication.

To ensure our results are timely and relevant, we will make every effort to routinely update the case data (bi-weekly for Texas DSHS, weekly for national CDC counts) in the *Data* folder as the outbreak progresses. The data we extract are preliminary, and may be subject to changes over time. 

* As of June 18th, NBC and CBS news do not routinely update their counts so data are pulled directly from public state departments of health and may be slightly discrepant to values reported to the CDC.
* As of June 10th, Texas DSHS appears to only report once-weekly, on Tuesdays
* As of June 25th, CDC will update their page on Wednesdays in lieu of Fridays, which will include data reported to the CDC through noon on Tuesdays.
* As of August 18th, Texas reports the end of the West Texas outbreak with a sum of 762 cases. https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak
* As of September 3, CDC now reports exact counts per state. Given that there are not time series data per state available, where case counts differ, we defer to the department of health in each state and historic reports.
