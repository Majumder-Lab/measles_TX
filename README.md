This repository provides all relevant codes and data to replicate the analysis of of the reproduction number and vaccination coverage estimates of MMR in the 2025 measles outbreak in northwest Texas. We additionally provide a supplemental appendix of extended methods, results, and sensitivity analyses to complement our publication.

To ensure our results are timely and relevant, we will make every effort to routinely update the case data (bi-weekly for Texas DSHS, weekly for national CDC counts) in the *Data* folder as the outbreak progresses
